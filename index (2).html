        <p style="width:900px;font-family:Apple Chancery;color:LightGray"> My name is Laura Sundal. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia and I now attend the University of Georgia. As a child I went to Brookhaven Methodist Church for preschool and enjoyed playing soccer and doing gymnastics. I grew up as an only child, but I have two half-brothers who live in California and South Dakota. My dad grew up in South Dakota on our farm and worked for Cox Communications, but is now retired. My mom has lived in Atlanta for the majority of her life where she met my dad. I went to elementary school at The Vanderlyn School and went on to study at St. Martin’s. </p>

          <p style="position: absolute; top: -250px; left: -200px; width:800px;font-family:Apple Chancery;color:LightGray">Throughout my life I have traveled to many places. I have been to various states in the U.S., including Colorado, Hawaii, and New York. Outside of the country I have been to Paris, Germany, Prague, Aruba, and other tropical islands. I enjoy traveling with my family, especially because it is one of my parents’ favorite things to do. My favorite place I have traveled is Paris. The summer of my sophomore year of high school, I participated in an exchange program where I was given the opportunity to live in Paris for three weeks. This was the first time I traveled outside of the country by myself. I had to rely on my years of studies in French, but it was often difficult to communicate with my host family. Traveling is something I hope to continue to do throughout my life, because there are so many different places I would love to see. </p>

        <p style="position: absolute; top: 175px; left: -650px; width:550px;font-family:Apple Chancery;color:LightGray"> In high school I participated in many different extracurricular, but my favorite two were cheerleading and golf. I was a member of the sideline and competition team for St. Pius X cheerleading all four years of high school. I made many friends through these teams that I still remain close with. The competitive cheerleading team challenged me physically and mentally, but even with the stress it often brought, I continued to enjoy it every year. The St. Pius X girls golf team was another one of my favorite activities. My best friend Isabel and I joined the team together and had a lot of fun playing in tournaments. I am glad that I have been able to experience so many things in my life so far, and I hope to continue to do so throughout college and even after.</p>
